## litteratureaudioScrapper
Scrapes tops books on [litteratureaudio.com](http://www.litteratureaudio.com/classement-de-nos-livres-audio-gratuits-les-plus-vus) and generate a RSS feed from it. The goal is listen to free french audio books using your favorite podcast reader.
When running `litteratureaudioScrapper.py`, it will generate `la.xml`, which you have to host online and fetch from your podcast app.
NB : Mine is hosted [here](http://pbeaudequin.free.fr/la.xml)
